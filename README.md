## Hello there 👋, I'm Haur (pronounced as Hal).

### I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer!
I am a highly motivated Frontend Engineer (React, Redux, GraphQL, Angular, Node and Typescript) and Web Analyst (Google Analytics), with several years of private and public sectors experience.

My background has helped me develop a systematic and analytical approach to problem solving. When working autonomously I keep current by researching and networking with peers - often discussing ideas and issues on stackoverflow and github.

Using my broad experience I have created a range of beautifully responsive websites with the user experience a priority.
