## Hello there 👋, I'm Haur (pronounced as Hal).

### I'm a Engineering Manager!
I am a highly motivated Software Engineer/ Engineering Manager (React, GraphQL, Angular, Node and Typescript) and Web Analyst (Google Analytics), with several years of private and public sectors experience.

My background has helped me develop a systematic and analytical approach to problem solving. When working autonomously I keep current by researching and networking with peers - often discussing ideas and issues on stackoverflow and github.

Using my broad experience I have created a range of beautifully responsive websites with the user experience a priority.
